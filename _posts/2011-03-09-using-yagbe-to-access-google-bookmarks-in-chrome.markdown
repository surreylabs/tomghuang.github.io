It’s strange that Chrome doesn’t have Google Toolbar, which can access Google Bookmarks that I use everyday. If you want to access your Google Bookmarks in Chrome, you can install a Chrome add-on called [YAGBE (Yet Another Google Bookmarks Extension)][yagbe]. It allows you to browse, edit, and search all your bookmarks in a simple user interface. It’s highly recommended for Chrome users.
