1. LOP is very important. First RD told me that they have to fix an issue by suspending the service. However, suspending the service will cause a lot of problem in TIS, and RD could not come out a solution which is good enough, and the whole thing is not predicable. But we try to find out the real reason for stopping the service, and we found that, Asus doesn't care whether the service start or stop. They found that, if the service starts, the OOBE process will be very slow. And when they stop the service, the OOBE process is normal. So, what they really care is the OOBE process speed, and they think our service slow down the process. So, the best way is disable the realtime scan and engines, so that our engines will not bother the OOBE process. Damn, we wasted a lot of time figuring out how to suspend the service, but that is not what we need.... Damn...

2. There are several important things about Corridor: 1. product license id is unique for each product; 2. there are four dimensions: version, sku, product line, business model; 3. serial number driven: provide an API to map serial number to the corresponding product license id; 4. should prevent duplication (corridor.xml), set locale, set vid, set xxx...; 5. how to servive when the license data goes wrong... 6. WSE will issue product license id, the WSE will keep track of all product license id; 7.
