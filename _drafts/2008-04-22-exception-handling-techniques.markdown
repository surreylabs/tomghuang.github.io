What can you do when an exception happens? Will you try to recover from the exception? How?

For many years, I really don't know how to handle exceptions. Basically, there are so many reasons that an exception can be thrown, so how could you handle the exception if you don't know the root cause? I think a proper handling method is to display a dialog, which shows debug information and let users send back the information for further investigation. The dialog also allows users to stop, continue the application.
