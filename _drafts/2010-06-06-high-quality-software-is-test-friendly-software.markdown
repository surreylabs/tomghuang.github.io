What does test-friendly mean? It means that a piece of software is easy to write test automation.

If we want to be more precise, the title should be automation-test-friendly software.

A test-friendly software should provide "stable" programming interface that can execute "all functions".

IC design industry is far better then software industry in defining stable interface.
TR-069 is a stable interface for controlling CPE, such as router devices, so that you don't even have to write the test automation system yourself. You can buy one from the market.
